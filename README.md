# k-NN-Algorithm-to-classify-Habermans-Survival-Data

I will utilize Haberman's Survival Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml. 
This dataset  contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

description of variables
Haberman's Survival Dataset includes 306 examples of surgery patients, each with 4 features.The survival status is coded as 1 for patient survived 5 years or longer and 2 for patients died within 5 years.The other 3 numeric features are :

1. Age of patient at time of operation (numerical) 
2. Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical) 
3. Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)
4. Survival status (class attribute) 
-- 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer 
-- 2 = the patient died within 5 year
